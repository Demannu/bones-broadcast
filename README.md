# Stripped Down Streamer
This does the absolute bare minimum, it outputs an audio and video feed from a USB device.

Solutions like OBS and Streamlabs have *nearly* no lag, but it's noticable through my Mirabox HD Capture Card.

I wanted a way to get no-latency or as close to that as possible with just an audio/video stream and python.

## Notes
* Configuration GUI is incoming
* You can manually change the src for both audio and video in their respective class inits
